# README

Bborough API is a RESTful API created with Ruby on Rails (v. 2.3.3), using PostgreSQL database, and statisical data imported as CSV files from various websites and 3rd party API's.

Where data was sourced from non-API references, I tried to keep the years for each set consistent to give better reliablity. As of 13th of October 2018, latest data for the month of August for most API's the information was correct. (Date given in app 01/08/18)
